The actual merge still didn't happen until after I'd reported the issue,
and then as ever things are now starting to propagate through the other
drm trees.  It seems fairly obvious that there is room for improvement
here, for example people could check that the code they're merging has
at least made it into -next.

OK, that sounds more promising than what had been visible to me.  It
would be helpful if you could be more communicative regarding these
issues, the drm trees and over the past couple of releases especially
the amdgpu tree take substantially more of my time than the rest of
-next.  Between the frequency of the issues, the length of time they
persist, the way your process will obviously trigger such issues and the
near total lack of response to my reports it really never feels like
that time is valued.
