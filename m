See below.

two clients they could cover each other.

I didn't follow this part. How does the priority come into play?

We have to keep switching the mode as the DRM clients come and go.

That won't work. If you are running two different containers, you may
have different compute runtime versions. Also, Mesa can be submitting
to CCS too for async compute, AFAIK.

To properly cover things, we should make it into per DRM-client setting
and switch the mode accordingly when different DRM client is run.

And for the given SKU with only one CCS, as explained earlier, it should
be already guaranteed that two different DRM clients are not active on
the hardware at the same time due to the address space mathing
requirement between RCS and CCS.

If this needs to be extended to multi CCS SKUs, then it'd be a bigger
implementation effort.
