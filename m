I've sent the other fixes instead, still missing 2 r-b's:

https://patchwork.freedesktop.org/series/174789/

I'll send 7/7 separately, and see what happens. If nothing else, it'll be on the mailing list to pick up. I believe that a concrete goal "Fix this specific code to work with PREEMPT_RT, it's the only thing holding us back", will eventually add motivation to merge the specific fixes, or develop another solution that will be accepted.
