The dmabuf release path is split between file and dentry release:
dma_buf_file_release() is called shortly before the file is freed, and
dma_buf_release() calls an exporter's dmabuf->ops->release when the
dentry is freed.  However, the dentry can outlive the file (for
example, if opened with O_PATH), meaning .release might be called some
time after the file is freed.

This presents a window, when closing a DMABUF file, in which
dmabuf->file points to freed memory yet .release op has not yet been
called.

For VFIO, if a buffer's .release has not been called it's considered
still active and subject to move/cleanup.  If so, it attempts to
get_file_active() on dmabuf->file: a file close with dentry held open
will call this function with a stale pointer, a UAF.

To make this pattern safe, set dmabuf->file to NULL in
dma_buf_file_release() to reflect that the associated file is now dead
even if the DMABUF is not yet gone.  A get_file_active() ... fput()
sequence concurrent with a file close then only executes as one of:

 - Gets the file before file_ref_put() (dmabuf->file valid)
 - Observes dmabuf->file pointing to a file, but it's DEAD (no file)
 - Observes dmabuf->file = NULL (no file)

Originally, drivers could assume dmabuf->file was valid until .release
was called from fops->release.  This assumption was no longer valid
after 4ab59c3c638c6 ("dma-buf: Move dma_buf_release() from fops to
dentry_ops"), which moved the callback to the dentry release (by which
point the file might have been freed).  With this commit, drivers must
still consider that dmabuf->file could be NULL before .release.
