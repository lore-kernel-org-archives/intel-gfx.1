The original patch for the conversion actually had this bug. There were some
failures reported by CI, pointing to a use-after-free after the changes.

Originally I thought it was due to the conversion itself, that the lifetime
was previously sufficiently by RCU. It makes sense that RCU itself couldn't
properly protect that, and that relying on it was a bug to begin with.

Thanks, I'll send this patch again separately and attach a stable tag!
Since you reported the issue, would you want to put your reviewed by
on the patch as well?

Kind regards,
~Maarten Lankhorst
