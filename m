I actually don't know of a swap backend that absolutely will not
allocate memory on swap out yet. Some backends allocate more than
others. Because the proactive reclaim can write to the non-offloaded
swap backend. That brings me back to my original question, in what way
this series helps.

So the answer seems to be that previously, some backends were unusable
by swap, due to possible memory allocation. With this series, those
back ends are usable for the proactive reclaim now. It is a 0 to 0.5
improvement because direct reclaim can't use it yet.

But proactive reclaim can also use the non-offload swap area. So if we
have plenty of non-offload swap area, both proactive reclaim and
direct reclaim can use that non-offload area. The value of this series
isn't apparent. If you don't have a traditional swap-capable backend,
then your non-offload area is zero.  That is considered a special case
of running out of non-offload swap area: never having a traditional
swap area in the first place.

Sorry I meant proactive reclaim can use both types, nothing constrains
proactive reclaim.

Flipping it around might provide additional benefit. I know some users
maintain off tree patches to turn off zswap on the direct reclaim path
exactly because zswap might allocate more memory before it can free
some. If the kernel can be smart about it. It provides additional
value to the status quo.

Yes, I feel that cluster-level marking might not be needed, you can
remember which si has the offload flag. However the per cpu cache
needs to know which context might require using a different cached
cluster. That is the trickiest part. The rest of the patch is just
enough plumbing to preserve whether the swap-out context is proactive
or not.
