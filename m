It should tear down the tunnel at that point.

I don't think that is good solution. We should get bottom of this so adding
Imre Deak to take a look from DP side. Do you have full dmesg with the
debugging enabled available somewhere?

Those happen until GFX reads the capabilites through the DP tunnel - its
normal (well unless it times out completely in which case it tears down the
DP tunnel as well but I don't think that happens here).

We also used to have similar issue, related to MST register access that
triggered DP OUT unplug but I think that's already worked around in the
graphics side for Meteor Lake.

Can you also repro this so that you enable tracing of the TB driver and
provide the output (alongside with the full dmesg so we can compare):

  # tbtrace enable

  <repro the issue>

  # tbrace disable
  # tbtrace dump -vv > trace.out

You can find tbrace here [1]:
