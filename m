There's a lot of different ways a commit could be fixed, and telling
the compositor things like "turn off this plane" wouldn't give the
compositor any actionable choices except giving up or exactly
following the hint.

If you meant much higher level things like
- reduce scanout bandwidth
- reduce connector bandwidth on this connector
- do a modeset

that's exactly what the proposed API does.

I don't think there's a middle ground between the two, KMS is too
complex for that.

It's useful because it tells the compositor that the failure is caused
by an implementation error in the compositor, instead of some driver
or hardware limitation. It doesn't need to be meaningful outside of
that, a developer later debugging what went wrong can use the error
string to figure it out.

I think that only works because the mode isn't specific to any display
or hardware. Atomic commit failures are often specific to some
combination of driver, GPU and display.

They can never be detailed enough to exactly pinpoint specific edge
cases, unless you give literally every single return path in every
driver an individual error code. I don't think that is feasible (and
then that error code would be uAPI).

That's the point? It's supposed to be not stable, so it doesn't become uAPI.

I don't think that's something you can ever fully get around. Just the
very hardware specific error cases alone make it impossible.
