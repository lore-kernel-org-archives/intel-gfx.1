They would not. On the impacted SKU, the RCS and CCS at any given time
can only run workloads with matching address space. Those workloads must
originate from the same DRM client as there is no address space sharing
across DRM clients implemented in i915.

It's only when multi-CCS SKU would need the same W/A, we would need
further scheduling decision to ensure 2 CCS workloads are not competing
for the global setting.

With per DRM client enforcement, both RCS and CCS should be able to
write the global setting without a conflict. And when a context from new
DRM client is scheduled it, it should be able to program the global
value to its liking as the same address space limitation guarantees the
other workloads are not in the HW anymore.
