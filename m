Hi all,

A fix for DMABUF's file-release path, to set dmabuf->file = NULL when
the struct file itself is being freed and avoid a stale pointer
lingering.  Previously it could be assumed that dmabuf->file was
always valid until .release was called, but commit 4ab59c3c638c6
("dma-buf: Move dma_buf_release() from fops to dentry_ops") separated
dentry release (calls .release) from file release (can happen before
.release).  Setting the pointer to NULL clearly delimits the period in
which it points to a valid struct file.

Raw dmabuf->file access is bad news unless the file is known to have a
reference held (for example, during export).  A single-threaded
problem scenario is a dentry held open (e.g. using O_PATH) but the
file closed; .release is not called, so the exporter was unaware that
dmabuf->file became stale.  Exporter activities using dmabuf->file
then led to a UAF.  Or, threads racing concurrent access with a file
closing.

VFIO uses get_file_active(&dmabuf->file), which is a UAF when the
pointer goes stale.  Alex Mastro has created a VFIO-centric reproducer
[1], which shows up with KASAN.

To fix, dmabuf->file is either valid or NULL.  get_file_active() is
then safe and a recommended way to access dmabuf->file without an
existing reference.  The only possible outcomes are for it to get a
reference to the file, to observe a valid pointer but the file in the
DEAD state (being closed, fail), or NULL (fail).

Patch [3/3] sets the pointer NULL when the file closes, which
get_file_active() handles correctly.

vmwgfx was identified as doing a problematic dmabuf->file dereference.
Although already a UAF, making dmabuf->file = NULL turns it into an
oops.  So, patch [1/3] correspondingly converts vmwgfx to use
get_file_active() too.

i915 GVT unsafely dereferences dmabuf->file for a trivial debug
printout after the file reference moves to the dmabuf's fd, so patch
[2/3] dereferences in the safe window.

Added comments to highlight that dmabuf->file could go away before
.release, and to use get_file_active() if a reference isn't otherwise
already held.


Thanks,

Matt

Changes:

v3:
 - Better comment for struct dma_buf's file (refer to synchronisation
   against ->release).
 - Added trivial i915 patch to remove unsafe debug dmabuf->file accesss.

v2: https://lore.kernel.org/all/20261009123601.94079-1-matt@ozlabs.org/

"v1" was the single "dma-buf: Annul dmabuf->file on file release"
patch:
