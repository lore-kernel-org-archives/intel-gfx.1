Aside of the horrible name (what is "ext"?) the whole mechanism is
creating a false sense of "safety" as the same problem exists when the
timer callback simply sets the new expiry time without invoking
hrtimer_forward().

Also why is Rust special and wants to delegate the external
serialization requirement to the hrtimer core code and thereby adding a
boatload of extra conditionals into the hotpath to distinguish between
the two callback variants?

Yes, you found an example for the downside of this design in the i915
code. That's not surprising because i915 is generally known for ignoring
documentation and making up their own rules just because they can. So
I'm not accepting this as an argument at all.

I agree with you that the lack of enforcement of that external
serialization rule is suboptimal. External serialization is hard to
validate/enforce in general though it's not impossible.

But let's first take a step back and look at the larger picture.

The obvious question is:

   Why is the base lock dropped when invoking the callback?

The answer is simply that the callback might and in many cases will
acquire a lock which is used in the reverse lock order for the purpose
of external serialization.

If you think about that then it's pretty obvious that you can introduce
a safe variant of hrtimer_forward() which can be invoked from the
callback:

hrtimer_forward_safe_from_callback(timer)
{
        base = lock_running_timer_base(timer);
        if (!hrtimer_is_queued(timer))
        	hrtimer_forward(timer);
        unlock_timer_base(base);
}

That prevents the scenario you described in a completely safe way, no?

Coming back to validation/enforcement of external serialization. That's
a problem which has been solved in other places already. Look at the
seqlock code for inspiration.
