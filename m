No bug opened for issue, no exact hardware config described, no dmesg logs.

Also, if you import a new dma-buf too frequently, probably shouldn't do
that.

You're literally echoing what code does or has in comments here. We can
see the code by looking at the code.

Please try to use less LLMs and use more of your own words for describing t=
he
changes or writing comments.

Patch description could literally have been around two sentences about
reducing the amount of unnecessary flushing.

> Fall back to wbinvd only when the buffer cannot be vmapped or is backed
> by I/O memory, where there is no CPU-side range to clflush.

Definitely no Fixes tag for what is essentially an optimization.
