Yeah the problem was similar, I believe neither check should exist,
instead the caller should give this information like the comment mentions.

It's best not to try to change i915 too much though, I can try without both
3/7 and 5/7 now that the plan is to disable some problematic perf events and
not run selftests in various conditions that should no longer happen.

Kind regards,
