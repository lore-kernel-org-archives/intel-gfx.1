Thank you for finally responding to these massive responses that seem to
have been ignored.

Please go back and respond to all of your previous submissions and ask
the maintainers involved to ignore them and not accept them so that they
do not unnecessarily take the time to review the patches.

Then follow what you say you are going to do here, one patch at a time,
and build up some actual experience doing fixes, not blanket massive
patch floods that are obviously wrong and harmful to us.
