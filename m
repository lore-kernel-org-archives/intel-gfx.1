Currently only set_deadline() can execute in parallel.

IIUC in our past discussions, your wish has been that the driver can
take its own locks with free locking-order in the callbacks.

Thus, the callback is invoked under lock in any case, just a few
instructions earlier or later. Thus, no callback ever truly executes
concurrently.

We asked for examples in our last discussions, and the only one ever
presented was the list-access requiring the fctx-lock in
nouveau_fence_no_signaling(). Nouveau is often not a good example.

Can you provide examples in the kernel where deadlock would occur?

Note that I pointed out that all callbacks are already invoked with the
lock taken, which proofs that it's doable. Future users with inline-
lock could employ various techniques for dealing with the lock-order.

Only exception currently is set_deadline(). The only user, MSM,
acquires the lock manually and then nevertheless triggers work on a
kthread, examplifying just one technique.

Look at patch 3. We might want to add some legacy support for shared-
lock, but it is evident how much more simple the code gets.

I even forgot that you also need a

if (!dma_fence_is_signaled_locked(=E2=80=A6))
