I don't mind taking the responsibility to debug and troubleshoot if things break.
Patch 7/7 fixes a real bug that is hard to trigger otherwise, but can most definitely
happen.

I believe it should be treated it as any other fix, merge it and when there are
bug reports, solve those.

Most of my energy and work is going to other projects now, so I won't be able to do
the entire validation in advance. I will definitely ensure CI is clean and passing,
it's how I came across this bugfix in the first place.

If bug reports come in and point to this patch, I will be able to take a look and
solve the reported issues, but I won't be able to hunt for them in advance.

It's only a few weeks until the -rc cutoff, so we can make it part of the next cycle.
