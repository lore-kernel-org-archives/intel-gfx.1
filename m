No worries.

Okay. And if it was cable issue it would not trigger only DP OUT unplugs
but wanted to verify.

Understood.

If you can put one full dmesg + trace somewhere that I could take a look
that would be great. Basically from the whole boot up to and including the
first double DP OUT unplugs. Maybe there is still something that could
point us to the culprit?
