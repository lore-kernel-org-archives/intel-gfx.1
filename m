Yes, you are right. It is definitely not a normal, everyday
workload. it is an extreme edge case that I caught unintentionally while
stress-testing vtag multiplexing during a broader CSME research project.
But because it results in an unrecoverable full system kernel and
DRM/i915 display freeze when hit, I thought it was important to document
and report it.

I appreciate the nudge. While the reproducer is straightforward, safely=20
resolving the cross-subsystem interaction between MEI and i915 without=20
introducing regressions seemed complex enough that I initially deferred=20
to the Intel maintainers.=20

However, since I've already mapped out the race in mei_ioctl_connect_vtag()=
,=20
I am happy to take a shot at it. I will work on implementing the localized=
=20
state checks to prevent vtag reuse during teardown, and I'll submit a=20
patch for review in the next few days.

The previous patch addressed a single-client teardown ordering issue where=
=20
incoming IRQ completions populated cl->rd_completed after mei_cl_flush_queu=
es()=20
was called, triggering a WARN_ON() in mei_cl_unlink().

This issue is a separate, multi-client race specific to Virtual Tag (vtag)
multiplexing in mei_ioctl_connect_vtag(). While mei_release() drops
dev->device_lock to wait for firmware disconnect, a concurrent thread
requesting a new vtag matches the tearing-down client on dev->file_list.
When the disconnect finishes, cl->me_cl is cleared/NULL'd while the client
is actively reused, resulting in CSME hardware reset loops and cascading
DRM/i915 display freezes.
