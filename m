TBH I was hoping we could just kill off the entire stereo 3d thing
because it makes dealing with modes annoying. But I guess we can't do
that if people are actually using it :/

There are no docs :(


On DP the VSC SDP can signal various stereo 3D modes (including
"Stacked Frame" which I think is what you want) whereas the MSA
can only signal the frame/field sequential modes.

Technically all DPCD 1.2+ sinks should support the VSC SDP, but
I don't think that really guarantees that a PCON would then
convert the VSC SDP to its infoframe counterpart.

I guess one way to verify whether it's really working would be to
just send the VSC SDP with the stereo 3D knobs in various
positions and see if the TV will respond accordingly.
