thanks for taking a look! I'd be very interested - mainly because in my 
understanding the "both VKMS and amdgpu have HW generations or configs 
where no color pipeline is created" should be fixable:

 1. For amdgpu every hardware generation supporting COLOR_RANGE and
    COLOR_ENCODING should be able to create a color pipeline *only*
    exposing the corresponding FIXED_MATRIX colorop, mapping to the
    exact same hardware block internally. I hope that shouldn't conflict
    too much with the current architecture?
 2. In case of VKMS the "enable_plane_pipeline" config could be adopted
    so that - if it is disabled - the plane pipeline is still
    initialized but only the FIXED_MATRIX colorop is added. Additionally
    we would need to disable DRM_CLIENT_CAP_PLANE_COLOR_PIPELINE -
    possibly by a driver cap similar to v1 of this series - so that
    userspace can't enable/use the colop-op directly. As a result, VKMS
    with enable_plane_pipeline=0 should get the legacy properties via
    your helper, be able to drop explicit handling of them.

Does that make sense / do you think that could work?

Best regards,

Robert

It's probably a good idea. It should be easy to make that change after merging the Fixed Matrix series with YUV support.

I sketched this out but both VKMS and amdgpu have HW generations
or configs where no color pipeline is created. For that we still
need the current way of COLOR_RANGE and COLOR_ENCODING handling.
Because of this the code to create COLOR_RANGE and COLOR_ENCODING
based on the color pipeline is not really simplifying things, but
merely adding more code.

At this point I am not convinced adding helpers to create COLOR_RANGE
and COLOR_ENCODING based on the color pipeline is a net positive.
Maybe in the future that equation changes.

If anyone is interested I'm still happy to share the code. Just
let me know.
